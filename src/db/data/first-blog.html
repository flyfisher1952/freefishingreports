            Welcome to Free Fishing Reports. The intent of this site is to provide a single place where anglers can go to see the fishing conditions
            on their favorite locations.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is intended to be a wiki-style website where anglers will post reports on what they've observed when they go fishing so that others can
            see those reports. So it will depend on your participation.
        </p>
        <p>
            So when you go fishing, please post a short report here. It should only include where you went, a rating like 'Good', 'Poor' or whatever
            and what worked.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a work in progress, so please have patience. I'm a retired software engineer with a passion for fishing and I'll be polishing the
            site as I go. For now, there is no place to make comments on these blog posts, maybe later. Send suggestions to
            <a href="mailto:flyfisher@freefishingreports.co">flyfisher@freefishingreports.co</a>. I don't own the .com domain yet.
